###Lender Relations Department:
In charge of keeping our lenders happy

####Lender Rating System
Just like Vendors and Tenants we need to track our high rated lenders. The ones we want to work with that treat us right.

At this point we have a property that needs financing. 


1. A Property Acquisition Presentation comes in from the Acquisition and Liquidations Department
2. Select the highest rated lenders and send it out to those lenders. Give them X amount of time to respond the follow up. If no interest is show proceed to the next group of lenders
3. 
4. Negotiate the terms - !!!MATT IS THE ONLY ONE WITH AUTHORITY TO APPROVE TERMS FOR NOW!!! Eventually this will be delegated once a standard model is established 
5. Work with the Legal Department to produce the paperwork necessary for the deal.
6. Get the check (and try not to lose it while swimming on a beach...JK) TODO: Figure out if it goes in our bank or direct to the title company
7. Inform the Acquisition and Liquidation Department that the funds are ready.




####Closing out a deal:






####Quarterly Reporting to Existing Lenders:
Work with the Finance Department to produce individual Quarterly Lender Reports to inform each lender as to the status of their investment.




####Quarterly Reporting to new Potential Lenders:
Work with Finance to produce a generic quarterly report that can be used as marketing material to raise interest in new Lenders.
