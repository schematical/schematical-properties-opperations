How to find a vendor


1. Create a list for each region
2. Research - Search for Vendors
	1. Ask on biggerpockets.com for references
	2. Ask our regional contacts/mentors/existing vendors for references
3. Check References - Get references from Call all references, 
	1. If a business: check with the better business bureau
	2. If an individual: do a background check
	3. If possible do both
4. Approval - ??Right now this will require Matt's approval but this will be delegated to the Director of Vendor Acquisitions
5. Create a file. This file will record all activity with this Vendor. After each interaction notes on the quality, professionalism, punctuality and cost of each vendor should be stored here
5. Contracts - Work with Legal Department to get contracts signed. Our contracts are prefered. 3rd party contracts must be approved by Legal(!!FOR NOW ONLY MATT SIGNS CONTRACTS!!!)
6. 


####Estimation:
Get a vendor(s) estimates for a rehab or maintenance.
